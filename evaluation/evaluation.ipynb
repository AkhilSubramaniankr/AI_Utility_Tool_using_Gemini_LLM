To curb his influence, Lord Vishnu took the form of a dwarf named Vamana and asked Mahabali for three paces of land. When granted, Vamana grew in size and covered the earth and sky in two steps. For the third, Mahabali offered his head. Impressed by his humility, Lord Vishnu allowed him to return to Kerala once every year. Onam marks this annual homecoming of King Mahabali.\n",
