However, knot layout procedures are somewhatad hocand can also involve variable selection. A third alternative is to adopt aBayesian non-parametricstrategy, and directly model the unknown underlying function. For this, we can employ Gaussian process models. Describing a Bayesian procedure as "non-parametric" is something of a misnomer. The first step in setting up a Bayesian model is specifying afull probability modelfor the problem at hand, assigning probability densities to each model variable. Thus, it is difficult to specify a full probability model without the use of probability functions, which are parametric! In fact, Bayesian non-parametric methods do not imply that there are no parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset. Rather, Bayesian non-parametric models areinfinitelyparametric. Building models with Gaussians What if we chose to use Gaussian distributions to model our data? $$p(x \mid \pi, \Sigma) = (2\pi)^{-k/2}|\Sigma|^{-1/2} \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu) \right\}$$ There would not seem to be any gain in doing this, because normal distributions are not particularly flexible distributions in and of themselves. However, adopting a set of Gaussians (a multivariate normal vector) confers a number of advantages. First, the marginal distribution of any subset of elements from a multivariate normal distribution is also normal: $$p(x,y) = \mathcal{N}\left(\left[{\begin{array}{c}{\mu_x} \\{\mu_y} \\\end{array}}\right], \left[{\begin{array}{cc}{\Sigma_x} & {\Sigma_{xy}} \\\\{\Sigma_{xy}^T} & {\Sigma_y}\end{array}}\right]\right)$$ $$p(x) = \int p(x,y) dy = \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, \Sigma_x)$$ Also, conditional distributions of a subset of the elements of a multivariate normal distribution (conditional on the remaining elements) are normal too: $$p(x|y) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_x + \Sigma_{xy}\Sigma_y^{-1}(y-\mu_y),\Sigma_x-\Sigma{xy}\Sigma_y^{-1}\Sigma{xy}^T)$$ A Gaussian process generalizes the multivariate normal toinfinitedimension. It is defined as an infinite collection of random variables, with any marginal subset having a Gaussian distribution. Thus, the marginalization property is explicit in its definition. Another way of thinking about an infinite vector is as afunction. When we write a function that takes continuous values as inputs, we are essentially implying an infinite vector that only returns values (indexed by the inputs) when the function is called upon to do so. By the same token, this notion of an infinite-dimensional Gaussian represented as a function allows us to work with them computationally: we are never required to store all the elements of the Gaussian process, only to calculate them on demand. So, we can describe a Gaussian process as adistribution over functions. Just as a multivariate normal distribution is completely specified by a mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is fully specified by a meanfunctionand a covariancefunction: $$p(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x,x^{\prime}))$$It is the marginalization property that makes working with a Gaussian process feasible: we can marginalize over the infinitely-many variables that we are not interested in, or have not observed. For example, one specification of a GP might be: Here, the covariance function is asquared exponential, for which values of [latex]x[/latex] and [latex]x^{\prime}[/latex] that are close together result in values of [latex]k[/latex] closer to one, while those that are far apart return values closer to zero. It may seem odd to simply adopt the zero function to represent the mean function of the Gaussian process â\x80\x94 surely we can do better than that! It turns out that most of the learning in the GP involves the covariance function and its hyperparameters, so very little is gained in specifying a complicated mean function. For a finite number of points, the GP becomes a multivariate normal, with the mean and covariance as the mean function and covariance function, respectively, evaluated at those points. Sampling from a Gaussian Process To make this notion of a "distribution over functions" more concrete, let's quickly demonstrate how we obtain realizations from a Gaussian proces

2025-07-12 12:01:22,608 - INFO - Summary: Gaussian Process (GP) models offer a powerful Bayesian non-parametric strategy for addressing non-linear regression problems, a common task in applied statistics. Traditional approaches, such as fitting pre-defined non-linear functional forms (e.g., sinusoidal, polynomial) or employing non-parametric methods like splines or kernel regression, often necessitate extensive model selection or ad-hoc parameterization, such as knot layout. GPs provide an alternative by directly modeling the unknown underlying function.

The term "Bayesian non-parametric" can be misleading, as Bayesian models fundamentally require a full probability model, implying parameters. However, in this context, "non-parametric" indicates that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset, effectively making them "infinitely parametric."

The foundation of Gaussian Process models lies in the properties of multivariate normal (MVN) distributions. A key advantage of using a set of Gaussians (a multivariate normal vector) is that the marginal distribution of any subset of its elements is also normal. Similarly, the conditional distribution of a subset, given the remaining elements, remains normal. These fundamental properties—marginalization and conditioning—are crucial for GP tractability.

A Gaussian Process generalizes the multivariate normal distribution to infinite dimensions. It is defined as an infinite collection of random variables where any marginal subset follows a Gaussian distribution. This inherent marginalization property is vital, as it allows for computational feasibility by calculating elements only on demand, rather than storing an infinite number. Conceptually, a GP can be understood as a "distribution over functions," where each sample from the GP is a complete function.

A GP is fully specified by a mean function, $m(x)$, and a covariance function, $k(x,x')$. While the mean function is often set to the zero function, as most of the learning and flexibility are captured by the covariance function and its associated hyperparameters, the covariance function defines the smoothness, variability, and other characteristics of the functions sampled from the GP. For instance, a squared exponential covariance function models the correlation between function values at different input points: inputs close together yield higher correlation (closer to one), while distant inputs result in lower correlation (closer to zero). For a finite number of observed points, a Gaussian Process reduces to a multivariate normal distribution, with its mean vector and covariance matrix derived by evaluating the GP's mean and covariance functions at those specific points. The marginalization property thus makes working with GPs practical, allowing inference on observed data while implicitly accounting for infinitely many unobserved points.

2025-07-12 12:02:44,077 - INFO - Summary: Gaussian Process (GP) models offer a powerful Bayesian non-parametric strategy for characterizing non-linear relationships in applied statistics, particularly in regression tasks. Traditional approaches to non-linear regression, such as assuming specific functional forms (e.g., sinusoidal, polynomial), often necessitate extensive model selection procedures to identify the most appropriate fit. Alternatively, non-parametric methods like spline or kernel regression, which define "knots" across the variable space, can describe arbitrary non-linear relationships but suffer from ad hoc knot layout and potential variable selection complexities. Gaussian Process models present a third, more flexible option.

The term "Bayesian non-parametric" can be somewhat misleading. While Bayesian procedures involve specifying a full probability model with probability functions, which are inherently parametric, Bayesian non-parametric methods are distinguished by the characteristic that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset. Rather than having no parameters, they are, in essence, "infinitely parametric."

The foundation of Gaussian Process models lies in the properties of Gaussian distributions. While a single Gaussian distribution is not inherently flexible, a set of Gaussians, represented as a multivariate normal (MVN) vector, confers significant advantages. Key properties of multivariate normal distributions include:
1.  **Marginalization:** The marginal distribution of any subset of elements from a multivariate normal distribution is also normal.
2.  **Conditioning:** The conditional distribution of a subset of elements, given the remaining elements, is also normal. These properties are crucial for the computational tractability of GPs.

A Gaussian process generalizes the concept of a multivariate normal distribution to an infinite dimension. It is formally defined as an infinite collection of random variables where any finite marginal subset exhibits a Gaussian distribution. This definition inherently incorporates the marginalization property, making GPs computationally feasible even when dealing with continuous inputs. A GP can be conceptualized as a "distribution over functions." When a function takes continuous inputs, it implicitly represents an infinite vector that only yields values (indexed by the inputs) upon request. This allows for computational efficiency, as there is no need to store all elements of the Gaussian process; they are calculated on demand.

A Gaussian process is fully specified by two components: a **mean function** ($m(x)$) and a **covariance function** or kernel ($k(x,x')$). The mean function typically models the expected value of the function at a given input $x$, while the covariance function describes the similarity or relationship between function values at two different input points, $x$ and $x'$. The general notation for a Gaussian Process is $p(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x,x^{\prime}))$.

The marginalization property is vital for working with GPs in practice, enabling users to marginalize over the infinite number of unobserved or uninteresting variables. A common choice for the covariance function is the **squared exponential kernel**. This kernel assigns values closer to one for input points $x$ and $x'$ that are close together, indicating strong correlation, and values closer to zero for points that are far apart, indicating weak correlation. It might seem counter-intuitive to adopt a simple mean function, such as the zero function, for a GP. However, most of the learning and flexibility within a Gaussian Process model are driven by the covariance function and its associated hyperparameters, meaning that a complex mean function often yields little additional benefit. For a finite number of points, a Gaussian process effectively reduces to a multivariate normal distribution, with its mean vector and covariance matrix derived from the mean function and covariance function evaluated at those specific points. The ability to sample realizations from this "distribution over functions" further illustrates the practical utility of Gaussian Process models.

Unless this relationship is obvious from the outset, however, it involves possibly extensivemodel selectionprocedures to ensure the most appropriate model is retained. Alternatively, a non-parametric approach can be adopted by defining a set of knots across the variable space and use a spline or kernel regression to describe arbitrary non-linear relationships. However, knot layout procedures are somewhatad hocand can also involve variable selection. A third alternative is to adopt aBayesian non-parametricstrategy, and directly model the unknown underlying function. For this, we can employ Gaussian process models. Describing a Bayesian procedure as "non-parametric" is something of a misnomer. The first step in setting up a Bayesian model is specifying afull probability modelfor the problem at hand, assigning probability densities to each model variable. Thus, it is difficult to specify a full probability model without the use of probability functions, which are parametric! In fact, Bayesian non-parametric methods do not imply that there are no parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset. Rather, Bayesian non-parametric models areinfinitelyparametric. Building models with Gaussians What if we chose to use Gaussian distributions to model our data? $$p(x \mid \pi, \Sigma) = (2\pi)^{-k/2}|\Sigma|^{-1/2} \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu) \right\}$$ There would not seem to be any gain in doing this, because normal distributions are not particularly flexible distributions in and of themselves. However, adopting a set of Gaussians (a multivariate normal vector) confers a number of advantages. First, the marginal distribution of any subset of elements from a multivariate normal distribution is also normal: $$p(x,y) = \mathcal{N}\left(\left[{\begin{array}{c}{\mu_x} \\{\mu_y} \\\end{array}}\right], \left[{\begin{array}{cc}{\Sigma_x} & {\Sigma_{xy}} \\\\{\Sigma_{xy}^T} & {\Sigma_y}\end{array}}\right]\right)$$ $$p(x) = \int p(x,y) dy = \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, \Sigma_x)$$ Also, conditional distributions of a subset of the elements of a multivariate normal distribution (conditional on the remaining elements) are normal too: $$p(x|y) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_x + \Sigma_{xy}\Sigma_y^{-1}(y-\mu_y),\Sigma_x-\Sigma{xy}\Sigma_y^{-1}\Sigma{xy}^T)$$ A Gaussian process generalizes the multivariate normal toinfinitedimension. It is defined as an infinite collection of random variables, with any marginal subset having a Gaussian distribution. Thus, the marginalization property is explicit in its definition. Another way of thinking about an infinite vector is as afunction. When we write a function that takes continuous values as inputs, we are essentially implying an infinite vector that only returns values (indexed by the inputs) when the function is called upon to do so. By the same token, this notion of an infinite-dimensional Gaussian represented as a function allows us to work with them computationally: we are never required to store all the elements of the Gaussian process, only to calculate them on demand. So, we can describe a Gaussian process as adistribution over functions. Just as a multivariate normal distribution is completely specified by a mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is fully specified by a meanfunctionand a covariancefunction: $$p(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x,x^{\prime}))$$It is the marginalization property that makes working with a Gaussian process feasible: we can marginalize over the infinitely-many variables that we are not interested in, or have not observed. For example, one specification of a GP might be: Here, the covariance function is asquared exponential, for which values of [latex]x[/latex] and [latex]x^{\prime}[/latex] that are close together result in values of [latex]k[/latex] closer to one, while those that are far apart return values closer to zero. It may seem odd to simply adopt the zero function to represent the mean function of the Gaussian process â\x80\x94 surely we can do better than that! It turns out that most of the learning in the GP involves the covariance function and its hyperparameters, so very little is gained in specifying a complicated mean function. For a finite number of points, the GP becomes a multivariate normal, with the mean and covariance as the mean function and covariance function, respectively, evaluated at those points. Sampling from a Gaussian Process To make this notion of a "distribution over functions" more concrete, let's quickly demonstrate how we obtain realizations from a Gaussian proces

2025-07-12 12:48:55,935 - INFO - Summary: Regression modeling frequently involves characterizing non-linear relationships, which traditional methods often simplify by assuming specific functional forms or using non-parametric approaches like splines. However, these methods can necessitate extensive model selection or ad-hoc procedures. A more effective solution is the Bayesian non-parametric strategy, which directly models the unknown underlying function using Gaussian Process (GP) models.

In a Bayesian context, "non-parametric" does not imply an absence of parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the dataset size, making such models "infinitely parametric." Gaussian Processes build upon the properties of multivariate normal distributions, which allow both marginal and conditional distributions of subsets to remain normal.

A GP generalizes the multivariate normal to infinite dimensions, defined as an infinite collection of random variables where any marginal subset is Gaussian. This allows GPs to be conceptualized as a "distribution over functions." Computationally, GPs are feasible because elements are calculated on demand, not stored entirely. A GP is fully specified by a mean function and a covariance function ($p(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x,x^{\prime}))$). The marginalization property is critical for their practical application. While a zero mean function is often adopted, most learning occurs via the covariance function and its hyperparameters (e.g., squared exponential). For a finite number of points, a GP behaves as a multivariate normal distribution.

2025-07-12 12:56:31,891 - INFO - Summary: Building regression models to characterize non-linear relationships between variables poses a common challenge. Traditional approaches, such as assuming a specific non-linear functional form (e.g., sinusoidal, polynomial), often require extensive model selection. Non-parametric methods like spline or kernel regression, which define knots, can describe arbitrary non-linearities but suffer from ad hoc knot placement and variable selection issues. A more robust alternative is to adopt a Bayesian non-parametric strategy, specifically Gaussian Process (GP) models, to directly model the unknown underlying function.

The term "Bayesian non-parametric" can be misleading. While Bayesian procedures necessitate specifying a full probability model with probability functions, these methods are "non-parametric" not due to a lack of parameters, but because the number of parameters effectively grows with the size of the dataset, making them "infinitely parametric."

Gaussian distributions are central to GP models, not for their individual flexibility, but for the advantageous properties of multivariate normal (MVN) vectors. Crucially, both the marginal distribution of any subset of elements from an MVN and the conditional distributions of a subset given others are also normal.

A Gaussian Process generalizes the multivariate normal distribution to infinite dimensions. It is defined as an infinite collection of random variables where any marginal subset exhibits a Gaussian distribution. This characteristic allows a GP to be conceptualized as a "distribution over functions," with computational feasibility achieved by calculating values on demand rather than storing infinite elements. A GP is entirely specified by a mean function, `m(x)`, and a covariance function, `k(x,x')`. The marginalization property is key to its practical application. While the mean function is often simplified to zero, as most learning is captured by the covariance function and its hyperparameters, for a finite set of points, the GP effectively reduces to a multivariate normal distribution, with its mean vector and covariance matrix derived from the respective functions evaluated at those points.

2025-07-12 12:56:57,837 - INFO - Summary: Gaussian Process (GP) models offer a Bayesian non-parametric strategy for characterizing non-linear relationships in regression tasks, addressing limitations of traditional methods. Conventional approaches, such as assuming specific non-linear functional forms or using spline/kernel regression with ad hoc knot layouts, often require extensive model or variable selection procedures.

The term "Bayesian non-parametric" is somewhat a misnomer; it does not imply an absence of parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the dataset size, leading to the description "infinitely parametric." Bayesian models fundamentally require specifying a full probability model, which relies on parametric functions.

The foundation of GPs lies in the properties of Gaussian distributions. While a single normal distribution is not inherently flexible, a multivariate normal vector offers significant advantages: both marginal and conditional distributions of its subsets remain normal. A Gaussian Process extends this concept to infinite dimensions, defining an infinite collection of random variables where any marginal subset is Gaussian. This explicitly incorporates the crucial marginalization property, which makes GPs computationally feasible.

Conceptually, a Gaussian Process can be viewed as a "distribution over functions." Similar to how a multivariate normal is specified by a mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is fully defined by a mean function and a covariance function. This functional representation means that values are calculated on demand rather than requiring storage of infinite elements. The marginalization property is key to working with GPs, allowing focus on observed or relevant variables while implicitly handling the unobserved. For instance, a common choice for the covariance function is the squared exponential, where proximity of inputs results in higher covariance. Often, a simple zero function is adopted for the mean function, as the majority of learning in a GP is attributed to the covariance function and its hyperparameters. When applied to a finite number of data points, a Gaussian Process effectively reduces to a multivariate normal distribution, with its mean and covariance derived from the GP's mean and covariance functions evaluated at those specific points.

Describing a Bayesian procedure as "non-parametric" is something of a misnomer. The first step in setting up a Bayesian model is specifying afull probability modelfor the problem at hand, assigning probability densities to each model variable. Thus, it is difficult to specify a full probability model without the use of probability functions, which are parametric! In fact, Bayesian non-parametric methods do not imply that there are no parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset. Rather, Bayesian non-parametric models areinfinitelyparametric. Building models with Gaussians What if we chose to use Gaussian distributions to model our data? $$p(x \mid \pi, \Sigma) = (2\pi)^{-k/2}|\Sigma|^{-1/2} \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^{\prime}\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu) \right\}$$ There would not seem to be any gain in doing this, because normal distributions are not particularly flexible distributions in and of themselves. However, adopting a set of Gaussians (a multivariate normal vector) confers a number of advantages. First, the marginal distribution of any subset of elements from a multivariate normal distribution is also normal: $$p(x,y) = \mathcal{N}\left(\left[{\begin{array}{c}{\mu_x} \\{\mu_y} \\\end{array}}\right], \left[{\begin{array}{cc}{\Sigma_x} & {\Sigma_{xy}} \\\\{\Sigma_{xy}^T} & {\Sigma_y}\end{array}}\right]\right)$$ $$p(x) = \int p(x,y) dy = \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, \Sigma_x)$$ Also, conditional distributions of a subset of the elements of a multivariate normal distribution (conditional on the remaining elements) are normal too: $$p(x|y) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_x + \Sigma_{xy}\Sigma_y^{-1}(y-\mu_y),\Sigma_x-\Sigma{xy}\Sigma_y^{-1}\Sigma{xy}^T)$$ A Gaussian process generalizes the multivariate normal toinfinitedimension. It is defined as an infinite collection of random variables, with any marginal subset having a Gaussian distribution. Thus, the marginalization property is explicit in its definition. Another way of thinking about an infinite vector is as afunction. When we write a function that takes continuous values as inputs, we are essentially implying an infinite vector that only returns values (indexed by the inputs) when the function is called upon to do so. By the same token, this notion of an infinite-dimensional Gaussian represented as a function allows us to work with them computationally: we are never required to store all the elements of the Gaussian process, only to calculate them on demand. So, we can describe a Gaussian process as adistribution over functions. Just as a multivariate normal distribution is completely specified by a mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is fully specified by a meanfunctionand a covariancefunction: $$p(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x,x^{\prime}))$$It is the marginalization property that makes working with a Gaussian process feasible: we can marginalize over the infinitely-many variables that we are not interested in, or have not observed. For example, one specification of a GP might be: Here, the covariance function is asquared exponential, for which values of [latex]x[/latex] and [latex]x^{\prime}[/latex] that are close together result in values of [latex]k[/latex] closer to one, while those that are far apart return values closer to zero. It may seem odd to simply adopt the zero function to represent the mean function of the Gaussian process â\x80\x94 surely we can do better than that! It turns out that most of the learning in the GP involves the covariance function and its hyperparameters, so very little is gained in specifying a complicated mean function.

2025-07-12 13:45:42,042 - INFO - Summary: This article discusses fitting Gaussian process (GP) models in Python for regression analysis of non-linear relationships.  Unlike parametric methods requiring pre-defined functional forms or non-parametric approaches like spline regression with potentially arbitrary knot selection, GPs offer a Bayesian non-parametric solution.  While technically "parametric" due to requiring a full probability model,  GPs are considered non-parametric as their parameter count scales with dataset size; they are, in essence, infinitely parametric.

The core of GP modeling lies in utilizing multivariate Gaussian distributions.  Key advantages of using multivariate Gaussians include the fact that marginal and conditional distributions of subsets remain Gaussian.  A GP extends this to infinite dimensions, representing a distribution over functions. A GP is defined by a mean function and a covariance function;  the covariance function, often a squared exponential, determines the correlation between function values at different input points.  The mean function is often simplified to zero, as most learning occurs through the covariance function and its hyperparameters.  For a finite set of points, the GP simplifies to a multivariate normal distribution.  The article concludes by briefly mentioning the process of sampling realizations from a Gaussian process to illustrate the "distribution over functions" concept.

Traditional methods, like assuming specific functional forms (e.g., sinusoidal, exponential) or using splines/kernel regression with knot placement, can be cumbersome due to model selection and ad-hoc procedures.  GPs offer an alternative.

While termed "non-parametric," GPs are infinitely parametric, meaning the number of parameters increases with the dataset size.  The core idea is to model the unknown function using Gaussian distributions.  A key advantage of using multivariate Gaussian distributions is that marginal and conditional distributions remain Gaussian.  A GP extends this to infinite dimensions, representing a distribution over functions.

A GP is fully defined by a mean function and a covariance function.

For a finite number of points, the GP simplifies to a multivariate normal distribution.  The article concludes by noting that the marginalization property of GPs allows feasible computation, as one only needs to calculate values on demand rather than storing an infinite-dimensional vector.  The process of sampling from a Gaussian process to visualize this "distribution over functions" is then briefly introduced.

While seemingly contradictory, "Bayesian non-parametric" doesn't imply a lack of parameters; instead, these models possess an infinite number of parameters, where the effective number increases with dataset size.  Thus, the choice of method involves trade-offs between specifying a functional form, selecting knots, and dealing with the inherent complexity of infinitely parametric models.

    Text: Wales held on for a first international win in 644 days as they ended their 18-Test losing run by defeating Japan in Kobe.

The tourists levelled the series at 1-1 as they withheld a spirited second-half Japan comeback in the heat and humidity under the closed roof at the Noevir Stadium.

Wales had built up a 21-3 lead thanks to two tries from scrum-half Kieran Hardy and a Josh Adams score.

But just as they did in their win in Kitakyushu last weekend, Eddie Jones' side rallied with tries from prop Shuhei Takeuchi, lock Warner Deans and centre Dylan Riley bringing the hosts to within two points.

But a late Edwards try, which gave the Ospreys fly-half a 16-point haul in his first Wales start, sealed the win and gave the tourists some joy for the first time in 21 months.

Wales previously recorded an international win when they defeated Georgia in the World Cup in Nantes in October 2023.

It was a welcome victory in the fifth and final game in charge for interim head coach Matt Sherratt and captain Dewi Lake cutting emotional figures after the final whistle.

Cardiff head coach Sherratt had taken over from Warren Gatland during the Six Nations in February.

Gatland's permanent successor will be unveiled by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in the next couple of weeks and will not now be burdened by the losing streak.

Creating and avoiding history
Following the tourists' 24-19 defeat in Kitakyushu, Wales were trying to avoid history in Kobe, while Japan were attempting to create it.

Wales were aiming to not set a tier one record of 19 successive international defeats, surpassing the sequence of France between 1911 and 1920.

The Brave Blossoms were looking to secure a maiden series win against Wales and back-to-back wins against a tier one side for the first time ever.

Sherratt said he wanted to freshen things up and made four changes with Ospreys fly-half Edwards making his first international start in place of Sam Costelow.

Number eight Aaron Wainwright and lock Freddie Thomas replaced the injured Taulupe Faletau and Ben Carter, while Bath tight-head prop Archie Griffin came in from Keiron Assiratti.

Scrum-half Naoto Saito, who won the French Top 14 title with Toulouse last month, returned to the Japan starting side.

2025-07-12 14:24:26,968 - INFO - Summary: Wales snapped an 18-match losing streak, beating Japan 28-26 in Kobe for their first win in 644 days.  This 1-1 series draw ended a tough period for Wales, who built a 21-3 lead thanks to tries by Kieran Hardy (2) and Josh Adams.  Japan fought back with tries of their own, but a late score by Sam Edwards secured the victory for Wales.  The win was especially sweet for interim coach Matt Sherratt and captain Dewi Lake, marking the end of their tenure.  The match also held historical significance, preventing Wales from setting a record for consecutive losses and denying Japan their first-ever series win over a Tier 1 nation.  Four changes were made to the Welsh team, including Ospreys fly-half Edwards making his first start.
